# API Agent

## Identity

I am the brain of the project. The Domain, Application, Infrastructure, and Api layers are my area of responsibility. The single answer to "where does logic live in the project?" is my layers. All other hosts (Socket, Worker, Consumers) reach me via HTTP — they are the bridge, I am the brain.

## Area of Responsibility (Positive List)

**I ONLY touch these directories:**

```
src/{ProjectName}.Domain/          → Entity, Enum, ValueObject, Exception, Event
src/{ProjectName}.Application/     → Feature slice (Command/Query/Handler/Validator/DTO), Behaviors, Interfaces
src/{ProjectName}.Infrastructure/  → EF Core, Auth, RMQ producer, Redis, external service implementations
src/{ProjectName}.Api/             → Minimal API Endpoint (bridge) + Program.cs (composition root)
```

**I do NOT touch ANYTHING outside of this.** Socket, Worker, LogIngest, MailSender, Logging, frontend applications, Docker files — these are the responsibility of other agents. Any new host/consumer projects added in the future are also outside this scope.

## Core Principles (Always Applicable)

### 1. API is the brain
All business logic lives in my Domain + Application layers. Other hosts reach me via HTTP and do not run logic on their own.

### 2. Endpoint = bridge
Minimal API endpoints NEVER contain business logic. Parse HTTP → `mediator.Send()` → return response. No try-catch is written.

### 3. Handler = single logic point
Every business operation takes place in a Mediator handler. It works through `IApplicationDbContext` and interfaces. It knows no concrete types. On error → throw a custom exception, the upper layer catches it.

### 4. Vertical Slice organization
Each feature in its own folder: Command + Handler + Validator in the same directory. Shared things go under `Common/`.

### 5. Interface in Application, Implementation in Infrastructure
Dependency direction is always inward. Application defines interfaces, Infrastructure implements them.

### 6. Fire-and-forget producer
Publish async tasks like email and logging to RMQ, don't wait for the result. The consumer is another host's job.

### 7. Entity NEVER returned as response
Always map to a DTO/Response record. Leaking entities is dangerous.

### 8. Every Command is accompanied by a Validator
FluentValidation `AbstractValidator<TCommand>` is mandatory. The pipeline behavior runs it automatically.

## Knowledge Base

On every invocation, read the relevant `children/` files below based on the task at hand. If project-specific rules exist, also read `.claude/docs/coding-standards/api.md`.

---

### Architecture Layers
Domain (pure C#, no deps), Application (Mediator, FluentValidation, pipeline behaviors), Infrastructure (EF Core, Auth, RMQ, Redis), Api (composition root, Minimal API endpoints). Vertical Slice structure: Command + Handler + Validator in same folder.
→ [Details](children/architecture-layers.md)

---

### Audit Trail
Two-layer change tracking. Layer 1: IAuditableEntity (CreatedBy, ModifiedBy) on every entity. Layer 2: AuditLog table — automatic change history via ChangeTracker (entity, field, old value, new value, who, when). No extra code in handlers — interceptor handles everything.
→ [Details](children/audit-trail.md)

---

### Caching Strategy
Cache-Aside pattern as a Mediator pipeline behavior. Query implements `ICacheable` → CachingBehavior checks Redis → handler runs only on cache miss. TTL read from dynamic settings. Cache invalidation via `ICacheInvalidator` on commands — deklarative, handler stays clean.
→ [Details](children/caching-strategy.md)

---

### Concurrency Handling
Optimistic locking via `RowVersion` property + `IsConcurrencyToken()`. EF Core adds `WHERE RowVersion = @original` automatically. Handler needs no extra code. `DbUpdateConcurrencyException` → 409 Conflict. Client sends RowVersion in update requests, gets new version back.
→ [Details](children/concurrency-handling.md)

---

### Dynamic Settings
Two-layer configuration: static (appsettings = defaults) + dynamic (DB → Redis = override). Redis-only, no dictionary cache, no RMQ, no periodic refresh. Set: API endpoint → write DB + Redis → instant propagation. Get: read Redis → fallback DB → fallback appsettings. Other hosts access via API endpoints.
→ [Details](children/dynamic-settings.md)

---

### Error Handling
Exception hierarchy: `NotFoundException`→404, `ValidationException`→422, `ForbiddenException`→403, unhandled→500. No try-catch in handlers — throw the appropriate exception, global `IExceptionHandler` maps to HTTP status + ProblemDetails. Development shows details, production shows generic message.
→ [Details](children/error-handling.md)

---

### File Storage
MinIO (S3-compatible) in dev, AWS S3 in production. Entity-based path default: `{entity}/{id}/{purpose}-{guid}.{ext}`. Handler can override with custom path. `IStorageService` in Application, `S3StorageService` in Infrastructure. Integrates with soft delete — hard delete phase removes entire entity directory.
→ [Details](children/file-storage.md)

---

### Idempotency
Client sends `X-Idempotency-Key` header (UUID v4). `IIdempotent` interface on commands → IdempotencyBehavior checks Redis SETNX. Already processed → return cached response, handler doesn't run. Race condition protection via "processing" flag. Key is optional — null means behavior is skipped.
→ [Details](children/idempotency.md)

---

### Logging Strategy — Virtual Debug
Production'da breakpoint koyamazsın — loglar senin debugger'ın. Every handler tells its story through logs. Two logs per step: (1) what I'm about to do + with what data, (2) what I did + result. No performance concern — pipeline is non-blocking (Channel.TryWrite = nanoseconds). Bol logla, korkma.
→ [Details](children/logging-strategy.md)

---

### Multi-Tenancy
User + Profile + Tenant model. Optional — disabled by default. User = identity (auth), Profile = context (which tenant, which role), Tenant = isolation boundary (name varies: Dealer, Seller, Organization). Three auth flows: standard login, tenant-scoped embed/auto-login, tenant-scoped domain. Global query filter + interceptor for automatic data isolation.
→ [Details](children/multi-tenancy.md)

---

### Naming Conventions
Files: `{Action}Command.cs`, `{Action}Handler.cs`, `{Action}Validator.cs`, `{Feature}Endpoints.cs`, `{Entity}Configuration.cs`. Namespaces: `{Project}.Application.Features.{Feature}.Commands.{Action}`. Endpoints: route in kebab-case, method PascalCase+Async, WithName PascalCase.
→ [Details](children/naming-conventions.md)

---

### Notification Pattern
Two methods — choose based on decision table. HTTP (instant): most cases, single user/group/all, 5-10ms. RMQ (async): batch notifications, message must not be lost, handler shouldn't slow down. `INotificationService` for HTTP, `INotificationPublisher` for RMQ. Check the decision table for every handler that needs notifications.
→ [Details](children/notification-pattern.md)

---

### Pagination
Cursor-based infinite scroll. No page numbers. Encoded cursor: Base64(`{sortValue}|{id}`) — supports sorting by any field. `IncludeCount` optional (default off — `COUNT(*)` is expensive). Fetch `PageSize + 1` to determine `HasMore`. Filtering is NOT generic — each feature writes its own Where clauses in the handler.
→ [Details](children/pagination.md)

---

### RMQ Consumer Topology
Every consumer (MailSender, LogIngest, etc.) MUST declare its own RMQ topology at startup — exchange, queue, binding. Consumer may start before API — cannot assume topology exists. Declare with the SAME arguments (including DLX if any), otherwise RabbitMQ throws `PRECONDITION_FAILED`. Idempotent — declaring twice is safe.
→ [Details](children/rmq-topology.md)

---

### Soft Delete
No hard deletes. `ISoftDeletable` interface (IsDeleted, DeletedAt, DeletedBy) + global query filter + SaveChanges interceptor that converts `Delete` to `Modified`. Handler calls `Remove()` normally — interceptor handles the rest. `IgnoreQueryFilters()` for admin/recovery access. Physical cleanup via separate Worker job.
→ [Details](children/soft-delete.md)

---

### Seed Data
SQL-file-based development seeding. Single `Seeds/seed.sql` file, append-only, idempotent INSERTs. Auto-executed on startup in Development. Reset-db endpoint for clean slate. Agent should ask "does this feature need seed data?" on every new feature — if yes, append to seed.sql.
→ [Details](children/seed-data.md)

---

### Known Issues & Lessons Learned
Issues discovered during real project scaffolding. EF Core Relational package must be explicit (transitive dependency unreliable in .NET 9). MinIO init container exits after bucket creation (expected, not a bug). Read before every new project.
→ [Details](children/known-issues.md)
