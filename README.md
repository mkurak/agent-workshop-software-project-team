## Recommended Companion Skills

- [Brainstorm Skill](https://github.com/mkurak/agent-workshop-brainstorm-skill) — structured brainstorming with persistent state
- [Rule Skill](https://github.com/mkurak/agent-workshop-rule-skill) — coding rule management with guided wizard
- [Core](https://github.com/mkurak/agent-workshop-core) — memory system, journal, save-learnings (auto-installed as dependency)

## Key Rules

- **Everything runs in Docker** — no local SDK installations (except Flutter)
- **Minimal API only** — no Controllers
- **martinothamar/Mediator** — source generator, not MediatR
- **LogIngest logs to console only** — prevents infinite RMQ loop
- **X-Internal-Token** for system-to-system auth
- **API is the brain** — all logic lives there, everything else is a bridge
