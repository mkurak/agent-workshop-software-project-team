## Skills (3)

### `/create-new-project [Name]`
5-phase scaffolder for a complete production-ready project from scratch. Asks key questions (project name, SaaS, modules, port offset, Claude Design opt-in), then creates the full stack: .NET API + Docker Compose + Postgres + RabbitMQ + Redis + Elasticsearch + logging pipeline + email pipeline + auth + optional Flutter/React apps. Includes `/verify-system` invocation as a mandatory final step.

### `/verify-system`
4-level end-to-end health check for this team's stack: containers running, ports accessible, applications healthy, pipelines working (logging / email / auth / socket / worker / redis / storage / audit). Returns a boxed pass/fail report.

### `/design-screen start "<description>" | done <handoff-url>`
Orchestrates the [Claude Design](https://claude.ai/design) loop. `start` derives a slug, gathers requirements via AskUserQuestion, builds a token-aware prompt, writes `intent.md` (status: pending-design), hands the prompt to the user. `done` finds the matching pending design (asks if multiple), fetches the bundle, briefs flutter-agent or react-agent for integration. State persists in `.claude/design/{slug}/intent.md` across sessions (brainstorm pattern). Requires Claude Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise; opt-in during project scaffolding.

## Settled Architectural Patterns

These are systemic capabilities the team enforces across all generated code. Each is documented in detail by the relevant agent's children files.

### UI-only i18n (1.0.3+)
Backend (API / Socket / Worker / LogIngest) is English-only. UI apps (Flutter, React admin, React public) localize via a `messageKey + placeholders + fallback` envelope inside `ProblemDetails.extensions` (errors), notification payloads (socket events), and EmailJob / PushNotificationJob (with `locale` field). MailSender + push dispatcher hold per-locale templates and render server-side. Enum values render via `{entity}_{field}_{value}` convention. Canonical reference: [`api-agent/children/user-facing-strings.md`](agents/api-agent/children/user-facing-strings.md).

### Claude Design integration (1.1.0+)
Optional visual-prototype phase between text-only flow specs (ux-agent) and code (flutter-agent / react-agent). The `/design-screen` skill orchestrates the round-trip; flutter-agent + react-agent gain handoff playbooks ([flutter](agents/flutter-agent/children/claude-design-handoff.md) / [react](agents/react-agent/children/claude-design-handoff.md)) for the React+HTML bundle; design-system-agent gains [token-authoring guidance](agents/design-system-agent/children/tokens-for-claude-design.md) for codebase readability; ux-agent gains [prompt-authoring guidance](agents/ux-agent/children/claude-design-prompts.md). Pilot evidence (walkingforme login, 2026-04-19): 1 iteration, 4/5 fidelity, 28 min total, 0 hex literals in resulting Dart.

## Recommended Companion Skills

- [Brainstorm Skill](https://github.com/agentteamland/brainstorm) — structured brainstorming with persistent state
- [Rule Skill](https://github.com/agentteamland/rule) — coding rule management with guided wizard
- [Core](https://github.com/agentteamland/core) — memory system, journal, save-learnings (auto-installed as dependency)

## Key Rules

- **Everything runs in Docker** — no local SDK installations (except Flutter)
- **Minimal API only** — no Controllers
- **martinothamar/Mediator** — source generator, not MediatR
- **LogIngest logs to console only** — prevents infinite RMQ loop
- **X-Internal-Token** for system-to-system auth
- **API is the brain** — all logic lives there, everything else is a bridge
